# Create A Tech Gadget Customer Support Chatbot
Imagine you own an online store that sells various tech gadgets. You often receive common questions regarding product specifications, return policies, shipping methods, and technical troubleshooting. To streamline customer support and provide immediate assistance, you decide to implement a simple chatbot.

In this exercise you will use Amazon SageMaker to create a chatbot that can respond to customer inquiries about:

1.`Product Information` (e.g., "Tell me about product X", "Do you have smartwatches?")
2.`Shipping Details` (e.g., "How long does shipping take?", "What shipping methods are available?")
3.`Return Policy` (e.g., "What is your return policy?", "How do I return a product?")
4.`Technical Support` (e.g., "My gadget wonâ€™t turn on", "How do I reset my device?")

What Your Chatbot Can Do
The chatbot should be able to:

*Greet the user.
*Understand and respond to specific questions about products, shipping, returns, and support.
*Provide a default response for unrecognized queries.
*Politely end the conversation.
